TMK Keyboard for Xerox DocuTech/Daybreak
=============================
This repository includes my Xerox DocuTech/Daybreak converter project (codenamed "Xericity") built with the [`tmk_core`](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_core) keyboard firmware library.

This firmware is expected to support all of the features available to TMK protocol converters. If you have any issues, please open a bug. Additionally, comments or suggestions are welcome in the discussions tab.

The latest TMK source code is available here: <http://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard>

FAQ
---
Q1. Will you port this converter to the QMK/VIA(L) firmware project?  
 A. At some point I am very likely to redo this to eliminate the dependency on AVR, and, at that time I will likely consider porting to QMK and/or VIA(L).
 
Q2. What type of hardware is required for this?  
 A. While this primarily targets my "Xericity" converter hardware, a homemade adaptor is possible. See the protocol docs for more information.
